Structures:
	collection of vlaues of the different data types.
	It is a user defined data type by which you can declare variable of its type.

syntax:
	struct struct_name
	{
		data_type var1,var2,...;
		data_type var1,var2,...;
	}struct_var1,struct_var2,....;

Eg:	struct Student
	{
		int roll_no;
		char name[24];
		float height,percentage;
		int total,marks[6];
	};

Structure variable declaration:
1. one way of declarating structure variable is,
	struct struct_name st_var1,st_var2,...;
2. We can declare a structure variable at the time structure definition.
	example:
C		struct Student
		{
		.......
		......
		}std1,std2,st3,.....;
Member Accessing using dot operator:
	In order to access the members in structure we use a dot(.) operator with the structure variable.

Syntax:
	struct_var.member = value;
	printf("format",struct_var.member);
Eg:
	std1.name = "Sateesh";
	std2.rool_no = 23;

Arrays to Structure:
	The structure variable may be an array, which can be used to declare array of structures.
Syntax:
	struct student std[25];
	std[0].name = "raga";

pointer to a Structure:
	Here we assign a pointer to a structure inorder to store the address of the structure variable.
Syntax:
	struct student std[20],std3,*ssp;

	ssp = &std3;

Accessing members using pointer to a structure:
	Syntax:
		ssp->name = "something";

Strucutes insde a structure:
	
	we can declare a structure inside another structure.
Syntax:
	struct Student
	{
		int no;
		struct DateOfBirth
		{
			int day,month,year;
		}dob;
	}std;
Accessing a member whcih is inside another structre:
	std.dob.day = 24;
	std.dob.month = 5;
	std.dob.year = 1996;
