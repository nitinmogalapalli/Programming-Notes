Pointer:-
-----------
                 Pointer is a special variable which represent a storage location in memory. A pointer variable is a variable that contain the address of another variable.

	Remember that the Ram has many cells to store value. Each cell in memory is 1byte and has a unique address to identify it. The memory address is always an unsigned integer.

Example :- 
--------------
 	65522,6640 etc.

In pointer use of two types of operator.

1. Indirection operator    
2. Address operator 

Indirection Operator:-
----------------------------
             This operator is denoted by * symbol and this symbol is called asterisk ( * ). Which is use to access the value of a variable through a keyboard.

Address operator (&):-
-----------------------------
	The symbol & (ampersand) is an address operator which is used to access the address of a variable and assign it to pointer to initialize it. 

Example:- 
--------------

Int 	a = 10
Int	*p	pointer integer 
p = &a;  // assign the address of a into p variable 

Pointer declaration:-
--------------------------
The pointer variable in the declaration is preceded by the asterisk (*) symbol.

Syntax :-
------------
	type *v1,*v2…………..*vn.

Here type represent any valid data type in c such as int, float, char etc.

*v1,*v2…………..*vn  represent the pointer value .

Examples:-
--------------
1. W.A.P. to print the value and its address of the variable.
	
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
main()
{
int a;
int *p;
printf("Enter the value of a=");
scanf("%d",&a);
p=&a;
printf("%d",*p);
printf("the address of a =%u",&p);
getch();
}

Output :-
------------
   	Enter the value of a  =  5
	5
	The address value of a = 65522.

2. W.A.P. to find the sum of two values using pointer.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
main()
{
int a,b,t;
int *p1,*p2;
printf("enter any two values=");
scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
p1=&a;
p2=&b;
t=*p1+*p2;
printf("the total of the two values = %d",t);
getch();
}

Output :-
------------
            	enter any two values  =  15
	10
	Total of two values  =  25.
