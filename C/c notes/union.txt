Unions:-
-----------
	Similar to a structure a union also consists of data members but only one data member is active at a time. Union use keyword union for declaration. The union is used when memory of computer is small.

Syntax:- 
----------- 
Union union identifier
{
Type data member1; 
Type data member2;
=======
=======
};

Here  type is a valid data type in c.

Data members:-
--------------------
These are variables.

Union identifier:-
---------------------
Represent the name of union.

Example:- 
--------------
union abc
{
int a;
float b;
char c;
};

Size of union:-
-------------------
	     The size of union is equal to the number of bytes occupied in ram by the largest data member in the union. Consider the following example . 

union student
{
int rollno;
char name[20];
};

The size of union is equal to 20bytes because the largest data member name occupies 20 bytes in ram.

Example:- 
-------------
W.A.P to find the size of the union. 

union student
{
int rollno;
char name[20];
};
Void main( )
{
Union student x;
Printf(“size of union =%d”,sizeof(x));
Getch( );
}

Output :-
            	The size of union is = 20
