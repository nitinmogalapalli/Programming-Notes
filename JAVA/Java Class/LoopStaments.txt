/* Looping Statements Syntaxs:
	1. while
		intitialization statements;
		while(condition)
		{
			statements to be iterated;
			increment/decrement;
		}
	2. do-while
		do
		{
			statements to be iterated;
			increment/decrement;
		}while(condition);
	3. for
		for(intialization; Condition; incre/decre)
		{
			statements;
		}

		a. for(;condition;incre/decre)
		   {
		   }
		b. for(; ;increment/decrement)
		   {
			condition statements should be declared here;
		   }
		c. for(; ; ;)
		   {
			[initilization];
			condition and/or incre/decre;
		   }
	4. for-each version of for loop
		for(var : collection)
		{
			statements;
		}
	here collection is a list/array of elements where the existance of the elements checked and if it is then the value can be stored into "var".
