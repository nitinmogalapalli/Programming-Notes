Constructor:
	It is a special method that initializes the Object at the time of its creation. 

	We define constructor using the same name as class name without having a return type not even void. why because the constructor's return type defined by the class internally by the same class type.

for eg:
	class Box
	{
		//Variables definition..
		//Constructor definition

		Box()
		{
			Constructor body...
		}
	}

Constructors with parameters:

	The constructors that are accepting parameters can take values at the time of object creation, and uses the formal parameters in the constructor's body.

	ClassName(Parameters List)
	{
		Constructor's Body...
	}
