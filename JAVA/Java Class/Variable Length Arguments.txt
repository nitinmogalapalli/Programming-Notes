Variable Length Arguments:
	With the advent of JDK 5, Java has included a feature that simplifies the creation of methods that need to take a variable number of arguments. This feature is called varargs and it is short for variable-length arguments. A method that takes a variable number of arguments is called a variable-arity method, or simply a varargs method.

Prior to JDK 5, variable-length arguments could be handled two ways.
	First, if the maximum number of arguments was small and known, then you could create overloaded versions of the method, one for each way the method could be called.

	In cases where the maximum number of potential arguments was larger, or unknowable, a second approach was used in which the arguments were put into an array, and then the array was passed to the method.

The varargs feature offers a simpler, better option. A variable-length argument is specified by three periods (...).

> A method can have “normal” parameters along with a variable-length parameter. However, the variable-length parameter must be the last parameter declared by the method.

type methodName(type arg1, type arg2, type ... vararg)

> The attempt to declare the second varargs parameter is illegal.
