Java is a strictly type language.
	Java will not allow the automatic convertion of the data type.
	for example: 
		In C the following statement is valid,
		int a = 4.5;		
But it is not allowed in java, if you use the statement like this will cause an exception/error.

Data Types:
	There are some inbulit data types.
byte	---	1 byte
char	---	2 bytes

	ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange
	inorder to represent ASCII Character you may require 1 byte.
	If you have to represent a character of a Language that is other than English, then you should require more than one byte.
	So the code required to represent the characters of different language we use Uni Code.
	If you are writing programs in english language JVM treats the character length as 1 byte.

short	---	2 bytes
int	---	4 bytes
long	---	8 bytes

floating Point Data types:

float	---	4 bytes
double	---	8 bytes

Floating Point values

In java Default Floating point data value is Double
	
	float f = 23.98;
it generates an error. To overcome you should use the statement,
	float f = 23.98f;

boolean	---	false
		true


Variables & Identifiers

variable is a name given to a memory location to store data on to the computer by using programs.

Identifier: Name given to something to identify it uniquely.

<DataType> Identifier/Variable name

Naming Conventions for declaring a variable:

1.Name can be of any number of characters
2.Name should be defined with meaning
3.spaces won't be allowed in the name
4.names should start with either characters, underscore(_), or a dollor symbol($), should not insert any operators like +,-,*,&,^,%,#,@..

Variable Names & Method names:
1.Each word should be capitalized except first word.

var1UsedToAdd
example:

variables---
	add,sub,mul,addSecond,matrixOne
Methods---
	add(),matrixAddition(),additionOfTwoNumbers()

class name:
	Each word should be capitalized.
	Ex: HelloWorld,Shape,Box,ShapeTriangle, MyFirstJavaProgram...


Defining of a Variable:
	Datatype variable_Name1[= value,[var_Name2 [=value2...]];
	Ex: int varAdd1;
	       int varAdd1 = 20;
	       int varAdd1 = 20, varAdd2 ;

Defining of a Method:
	Access_Spec [static] Ret_Type [Abstract] methodName([Arguments Declaration])
{
	Local varaiable Declaration;

	Instructions to perform some task;
}
