Data Reading:
	In Java we can read data in three ways.
	a. Through Command line arguments
	b. Using Scanner Class(>=1.5)
	c. I/O Streams

Any data you entered from the console treated as string by default. We need to convert the data to the specific format using some convertion mechanism.

	Java Provides some classes called Wrapper Classes where the objects of one type of class can be wrapped with another.

	Using the methods in Wrapper Classes we convert the data in string format to any type of data. For this we have a method called parseXXXX(String);
Here XXXX is the respective Wrapper class which represents the type to which you want to convert the string.

int	---	Integer
char	---	Character
double	---	Double
byte	---	Byte
boolean	---	Boolean
float	---	Float
long	---	Long
short	---	Short

using these classes we can convert the string to the respective type by calling the method parseXXX() with the class name.

a. Using Command line we can enter data at runtime. That data is treated as String Type so we need to convert that in to the desired type using wrapper classes.

b. Using Scanner Class
	In Order to use the scanner class we need import it from the pacakge "java.util.*".
so in that package if we need to use the scanner methods we need to declare the object of its type.
	syntax:
	Scanner s_obj = new Scanner(System.in);

	When you declare an object to this class you can access the members of it using a dot operator.
	s_obj.nextXXX();

c. Input / Output Streams
	Java has provided you the facility to access the devices using streams whcih can be of input and output streams.

	Data input/output using stream can be done in two ways :
	1. Byte Streams
	2. Character Streams
	
Inorder to use the Stream classes you need to import the package which contain the input and output streams that is "java.io.*" package.
