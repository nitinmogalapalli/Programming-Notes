Object Oriented Methodology(Approach):
	We have used the procedure oriented programming approach in writing program using BASIC, PASCAL, C, etc. In this approach we give importance to the Functionality rather than concentrating on Data.

	The procedural approach won't be applied to the programs that are related to the real world.

	Object oriented Approach(Methodology) which deals with the objects.
	Real world Object: It is a Real world entity, which exibit some properties and behaviours.
	Software Object: It is a software/memory representation of a type.

the properties of the object represents the state of the object. 

the operations that perform on that object to change its state is the behaviour of the object.

The objects exibit the similar behaviour(properties and Operations) fall on to same category.
or
The objects belongs to some category exibits similar behaviour.

	class: The group/collection/category of objects that exibit similar behaviour belongs to some class.
