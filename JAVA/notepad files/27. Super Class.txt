Super Keyword:-
-----------------------
The 'this' reference variable always refers to the current class and the 'super' reference variable always refers to the immediate super class. The 'super' keyword can be applied in 3 categories.

1. To refer to the variables of the super class.
2. To refer to the methods of the super class.
3. To call a super class constructor from the sub class constructors.

Function Overriding:-
------------------------------
It is the concept of polymorphism. whenever a function of super class also defined in the sub class, then the function is known as overridden. In the below example display() is also defined in child class.

Example : Demo of function overloading:-
---------------------------------------------------------
class A
{
int X;
void display()
{
System.out.println("X value of class A is:"+x);
}
}
class B extends A
{
int x;
void accept (int a,int b)
{
super.x=a;
this.x=b;
}
void display()
{
super.display();
System.out.println("X value of class B is :"+x);
}
}
class Inherit
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
B b=new B();
b.accept(10,20);
b.display();
}
}
