SQL BETWEEN Clause Statement:-
--------------------------------------------------
SQL BETWEEN clause used for fetching within range data. SQL BETWEEN is simply a shorthand way of expressing an inclusive range comparison.

SQL Between clause support only range type value like number, dates, character. But not supporting boolean, string value range.

Syntax:-
-----------
Considering following syntax that help you to understanding BETWEEN clause,

SELECT * FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name 
    BETWEEN lower_bound_value AND upper_bound_value;

When SQL query with BETWEEN clause parse into SQL Buffer, it will automatically expand out into separate comparison clauses.

SELECT * FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name <= lower_bound_value 
    AND column_name >= upper_bound_value;

Example:-
--------------
In this example select all users_info table rows with range between no column value 1 to 5.

Ex:-
------
SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE no BETWEEN 1 AND 5;

SQL BETWEEN WITH NOT IN Example:-
----------------------------------------------------------
In this example select all users_info table rows with range NOT IN between no column value 1 to 5. Use only NOT keyword instead of NOT IN.

Ex:-
-----
SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE no NOT BETWEEN 6 AND 10;
