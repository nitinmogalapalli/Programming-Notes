Introduction PL/SQL:-
-------------------------------
PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) program executes on Oracle database.

PL/SQL includes procedural language elements (like declaration, conditions, looping), also, you can able to handle a runtime exception.

PL/SQL is a Procedural Language extension of Structured Query Language (SQL). 

PL/SQL is specially designed for Database oriented activities. Oracle PL/SQL allows you to perform data manipulation operation those are safe and flexible.

PL/SQL is a very secure functionality tool for manipulating, controlling, validating, and restricting unauthorized access data from the SQL database.

Using PL/SQL we can improve application performance. It also allows to deal with errors so we can provide user friendly error messages.

PL/SQL have a great functionality to display multiple records from the multiple tables at the same time.

PL/SQL is capable to send entire block of statements and execute it in the Oracle engine at once.

Advantages PL/SQL:-
------------------------------
Procedural language support : 
------------------------------------------
PL/SQL is a development tools not only for data manipulation futures but also provide the conditional checking, looping or branching operations same as like other programming language.

Reduces network traffic : 
----------------------------------
This one is great advantages of PL/SQL. Because PL/SQL nature is entire block of SQL statements execute into oracle engine all at once so it's main benefit is reducing the network traffic.

Error handling : 
----------------------
PL/SQL is dealing with error handling, It's permits the smart way handling the errors and giving user friendly error messages, when the errors are encountered.

Declare variable : 
-------------------------
PL/SQL gives you control to declare variables and access them within the block. The declared variables can be used at the time of query processing.

Intermediate Calculation : 
-----------------------------------
Calculations in PL/SQL done quickly and efficiently without using Oracle engines. This improves the transaction performance.

Portable application : 
-----------------------------
Applications are written in PL/SQL are portable in any Operating system. PL/SQL applications are independence program to run any computer.
