Block-level Elements:-
------------------------------
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The <div> element is a block-level element.

Examples of block-level elements:

<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>

Inline Elements:-
-----------------------
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>

The <div> Element:-
----------------------------
The <div> element is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style and class are common.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">
