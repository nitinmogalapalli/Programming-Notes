HTML Block Elements and Inline Elements:-
-----------------------------------------------------------
Most HTML elements are defined as block level elements or inline elements.

Block level elements normally start (and end) with a new line, when displayed in a browser.

Examples: <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <table>

Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.

Examples: <b>, <td>, <a>, <img>

The HTML <div> Element

The HTML <div> element is a block level element that can be used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no special meaning. It has no required attributes, but style and class are common.

Because it is a block level element, the browser will display line breaks before and after it.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content.

The HTML <span> Element

The HTML <span> element is an inline element that can be used as a container for text.

The <span> element has no special meaning. It has no required attributes, but style and class are common.

Unlike <div>, which is formatted with line breaks, the <span> element does not have any automatic formatting.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My <span style="color:red">Important</span> Heading</h1>

</body>
</html>
