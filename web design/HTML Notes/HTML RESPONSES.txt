<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<style>
.city {
float: left;
margin: 5px;
padding: 15px;
width: 300px;
height: 300px;
border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
</head>

<body>

<h2>London</h2>
<p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
<p>It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom,
with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital and most populous city of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area,
and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

Using Bootstrap:-
------------------------
Another way to create a responsive design, is to use an already existing CSS framework.

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive webs.

Bootstrap helps you to develop sites that look nice at any size; screen, laptop, tablet, or phone:

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>

<body>

<div class="container">
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1>W3Schools Demo</h1>
  <p>Resize this responsive page!</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
    <p>It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom,
    with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <p>Paris is the capital and most populous city of France.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Tokyo</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area,
    and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p>
