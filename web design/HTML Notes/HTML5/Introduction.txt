HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

HTML5 is a cooperation between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

The new standard incorporates features like video playback and drag-and-drop that have been previously dependent on third-party browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Google Gears.

Browser Support:-
------------------------
The latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera all support many HTML5 features and Internet Explorer 9.0 will also have support for some HTML5 functionality.

The mobile web browsers that come pre-installed on iPhones, iPads, and Android phones all have excellent support for HTML5.

New Features:-
--------------------
HTML5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that helps in building a modern website. Following are great features introduced in HTML5.

    New Semantic Elements - These are like <header>, <footer>, and <section>.

    Forms 2.0 - Improvements to HTML web forms where new attributes have been introduced for <input> tag.

    Canvas - This supports a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program with JavaScript.

    Audio & Video - You can embed audio or video on your web pages without resorting to third-party plugins.

        Drag and drop - Drag and drop the items from one location to another location on a the same webpage.

But HTML5 is coming with lots of flexibility and would support the followings -

    Uppercase tag names.
    Quotes are optional for attributes.
    Attribute values are optional.
    Closing empty elements are optional.

The DOCTYPE: 
---------------------
DOCTYPEs in older versions of HTML were longer because the HTML language was SGML based and therefore required a reference to a DTD. 

HTML 5 authors would use simple syntax to specify DOCTYPE as follows: 

<!DOCTYPE html>

 HTML5 Document: 
 -------------------------
The following tags have been introduced for better structure: 

?  section: This tag represents a generic document or application section. It can be used together with h1-h6 to indicate the document structure. 

?  article: This tag represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article.  

?  aside: This tag represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of 
the page. 

?  header: This tag represents the header of a section. 

?  footer: This tag represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright information, et cetera. 

?  nav: This tag represents a section of the document intended for navigation.
 
?  dialog: This tag can be used to mark up a conversation. 

?  figure: This  tag  can  be  used  to  associate  a  caption  together  with  some  embedded content, such as a graphic or video.
