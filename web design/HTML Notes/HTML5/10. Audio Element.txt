HTML5 Audio:-
-------------------
HTML5 provides a standard for playing audio files.

Before HTML5, there was no standard for playing audio files on a web page.

Before HTML5, audio files could only be played with a plug-in (like flash).

The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.

The HTML <audio> Element:-
--------------------------------------
To play an audio file in HTML, use the <audio> element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

</body>
</html>

HTML Audio - How It Works:-
---------------------------------------
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

Text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will display in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

Multiple <source> elements can link to different audio files. The browser will use the first recognized format.
