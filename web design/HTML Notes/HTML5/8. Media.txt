What is Multimedia?

Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see.

Examples: Pictures, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.

Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.

In this chapter you will learn about the different multimedia formats.

The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.

Later came browsers with support for colors and fonts, and even support for pictures!

The support for sounds, animations, and videos is handled differently by various browsers. Different types and formats are supported, and some formats require extra helper programs (plug-ins) to work.

Hopefully this will become history. HTML5 multimedia promises an easier future for multimedia.

Multimedia Formats:-
----------------------------
Multimedia elements (like sounds or videos) are stored in media files.

The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension. When a browser sees the file extension .htm or .html, it will treat the file as an HTML file. The .xml extension indicates an XML file, and the .css extension indicates a style sheet file. Pictures are recognized by extensions like .gif, .png and .jpg.

Multimedia files also have their own formats and different extensions like: .swf, .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.
