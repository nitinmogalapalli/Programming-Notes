HTML5 <article> Element:-
-----------------------------------
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where an <article> element can be used:

Forum post
Blog post
Newspaper article

Example:-
-------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<article>
  <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article>

</body>
</html>
