What is HTML:-
--------------------
HTML is a language for describing web pages.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is a markup language
A markup language is a set of markup tags
The tags describe document content
HTML documents contain HTML tags and plain text
HTML documents are also called web pages
				
HTML Tags:-
----------------
HTML markup tags are usually called HTML tags

HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets like <html>
HTML tags normally come in pairs like <b> and </b>
The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
The end tag is written like the start tag, with a forward slash before the tag name
Start and end tags are also called opening tags and closing tags


ex:-
----
 	<tagname>content</tagname>

HTML Elements:-
---------------------
	"HTML tags" and "HTML elements" are often used to describe the same thing.

An HTML element is everything between the start tag and the end tag, including the tags:

HTML Element:-
---------------------
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Web Browsers:-
-------------------
The purpose of a web browser (such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them as web pages.

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to determine how the content of the HTML page is to be presented/displayed to the user.

HTML Versions:-
---------------------
Since the early days of the web, there have been many versions of HTML:

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration:-
----------------------------------------
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration helps the browser to display a web page correctly.

There are many different documents on the web, and a browser can only display an HTML page 100% correctly if it knows the HTML type and version used. 
Common Declarations

HTML5:-
------------
	<!DOCTYPE html> 

Writing HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit:-
-----------------------------------------------------
HTML can be edited by using a professional HTML editor like:

    Adobe Dreamweaver
    Microsoft Expression Web
    CoffeeCup HTML Editor

However, for learning HTML we recommend a text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac). We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.

Structure of a Html Program:-
------------------------------------
A HTML document is basically separated in two parts: the head (HTML head tag) and the body (HTML body tag). We also add a Document type declaration on top of it to get the basic document structure and HTML version.  The structure of a HTML document is shown below.

<! DOCTYPE …>  version information
<HTML>
 <HEAD>
   ...information about document, scripts, styles….
 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
   ...visible content of document….
 </BODY>
</HTML>

HTML document begins and ends with HTML tag i.e. <HTML> </HTML>
Here <HTML> indicates the browser that it is a HTML document and </HTML> tells the browser that HTML document is completed.

• Header Tag i.e. <HEAD></HEAD>
Header Tag does not contain any text, it only contains the Title Tag in it.

• Title tag i.e. <TITLE></TITLE>
Anything written between this tag is not displayed on the screen but it is used to identify the Webpage.

• Body tag i.e.<BODY></BODY>
This is the main part of HTML document. The content which is to be displayed on screen as webpage should be written here. Body Tag contains the text as well as various tags but only the text will be displayed on Webpage.

Ex:-
-----
<html>
<head>
<title>   My First WEB PAGE </title>
</head>
<body>
HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language
</body>
</html>
