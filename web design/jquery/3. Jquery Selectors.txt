jQuery Selectors:-
-------------------------
jQuery Selectors are used to select and manipulate HTML elements. They are very important part of jQuery library.

With jQuery selectors, you can find or select HTML elements based on their id, classes, attributes, types and much more from a DOM.

In simple words, you can say that selectors are used to select one or more HTML elements using jQuery and once the element is selected then you can perform various operation on that.

All jQuery selectors start with a dollor sign and parenthesis e.g. $(). It is known as the factory function.

The $() factory function:-
-----------------------------------
Every jQuery selector start with thiis sign $(). This sign is known as the factory function. It uses the three basic building blocks while selecting an element in a given document.

S.No.	Selector		Description
--------	------------		-----------------
1)	Tag Name:	It represents a tag name available in the DOM.

For example: $('p') selects all paragraphs'p'in the document.

2)	Tag ID:		It represents a tag available with a specific ID in the DOM.

For example: $('#real-id') selects a specific element in the document that has an ID of real-id.

3)	Tag Class:	It represents a tag available with a specific class in the DOM.

For example: $('real-class') selects all elements in the document that have a class of real-class.

Let's take a simple example to see the use of Tag selector. This would select all the elements with a tag name
and the background color is set to "pink".

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
 <title>First jQuery Example</title>  
<script src="">  
 </script>  
 <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">  
 $(document).ready(function() 
 {  
 $("p").css("background-color", "pink");  
 });  
 </script>  
 </head>  
<body>  
<p>This is first paragraph.</p>  
<p>This is second paragraph.</p>  
<p>This is third paragraph.</p>  
</body>  
</html>

How to use Selectors:-

The jQuery selectors can be used single or with the combination of other selectors. They are required at every steps while using jQuery. They are used to select the exact element that you want from your HTML document.
