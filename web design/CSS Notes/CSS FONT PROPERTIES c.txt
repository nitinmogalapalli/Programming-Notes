CSS font properties:-
-----------------------------
CSS font properties define the font family, boldness, size, and the style of a text.

Font Family:-
------------------
The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.

The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font.

Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".

More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list:

<html>
<head>
<style>
.serif 
{
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}

.sansserif 
{
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS font-family</h1>
<p class="serif">This is a paragraph, shown in the Times New Roman font.</p>
<p class="sansserif">This is a paragraph, shown in the Arial font.</p>

</body>
</html>

Font Style:-
----------------
The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.

This property has three values:

    normal - The text is shown normally
    italic - The text is shown in italics
    oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)

<html>
<head>
<style>
.normal 
{
    font-style: normal;
}

.italic 
{
    font-style: italic;
}

.oblique 
{
    font-style: oblique;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="normal">This is a paragraph in normal style.</p>
<p class="italic">This is a paragraph in italic style.</p>
<p class="oblique">This is a paragraph in oblique style.</p>

</body>
</html>

Font Size:-
----------------
The font-size property sets the size of the text.

Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.

Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> - <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.

Absolute size:-
--------------------
    Sets the text to a specified size
    Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
    Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known

Relative size:-
-------------------
    Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
    Allows a user to change the text size in browsers

<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 
{
    font-size: 40px;
}

h2 
{
    font-size: 30px;
}

p 
{
    font-size: 14px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
