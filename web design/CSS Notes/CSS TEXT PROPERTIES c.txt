Text Color:-
---------------
The color property is used to set the color of the text.

With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

    a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
    an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
    a color name - like "red"

Ex:-
------
<html>
<head>
<style>
body 
{
    color: red;
}

h1 
{
    color: #00ff00;
}

.ex 
{
    color: rgb(0,0,255);
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is an ordinary paragraph. Notice that this text is red. The default text-color for a page is defined in the body selector.</p>
<p class="ex">This is a paragraph with class="ex". This text is blue.</p>

</body>
</html>

Text Alignment:-
----------------------
The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.

Text can be centered, or aligned to the left or right, or justified.

When text-align is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight (like in magazines and newspapers).

Example:-
--------------
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 
{
    text-align: center;
}

.date 
{
    text-align: right;
}

.main 
{
    text-align: justify;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS text-align Example</h1>
<p class="date">May, 2009</p>
<p class="main">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 
'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Resize the browser window to see how the value "justify" works.</p>

</body>
</html>

Text Decoration:-
-----------------------
The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text.

The text-decoration property is mostly used to remove underlines from links for design purposes:

<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 
{
    text-decoration: overline;
}

h2 
{
    text-decoration: line-through;
}

h3 
{
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>

</body>
</html>

Text Transformation:-
----------------------------
The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.

It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word.

<html>
<head>
<style>
.uppercase 
{
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

.lowercase 
{
    text-transform: lowercase;
}

.capitalize 
{
    text-transform: capitalize;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="uppercase">This is some text.</p>
<p class="lowercase">This is some text.</p>
<p class="capitalize">This is some text.</p>

</body>
</html>

Text Indentation:-
------------------------
The text-indent property is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text.

<html>
<head>
<style>
p 
{
    text-indent: 50px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'</p>

</body>
</html>
