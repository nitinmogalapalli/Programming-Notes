MySQL IN Condition:-
-------------------------------
The MySQL IN condition is used to reduce the use of multiple OR conditions in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement.

Syntax:
----------
expression IN (value1, value2, .... value_n);  

Parameters
----------------
expression: It specifies a value to test.

value1, value2, ... or value_n: These are the values to test against expression. If any of these values matches expression, then the IN condition will evaluate to true. This is a quick method to test if any one of the values matches expression.

MySQL IN Example:-
------------------------------
Consider a table "officers", having the following data.

SELECT *  
FROM officers  
WHERE officer_name IN ('Ajeet', 'Vimal', 'Deepika');
