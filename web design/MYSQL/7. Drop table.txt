MySQL DROP Table:-

This example specifies how to drop a table. In this example, we are dropping the table "cus_tbl".

MySQL TRUNCATE Table vs DROP Table:-
-----------------------------------------------------------
You can also use DROP TABLE command to delete complete table but it will remove complete table data and structure both. You need to re-create the table again if you have to store some data. But in the case of TRUNCATE TABLE, it removes only table data not structure. You don't need to re-create the table again because the table structure already exists.
