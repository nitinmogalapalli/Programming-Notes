MySQL ORDER BY Clause:-
----------------------------------------
The MYSQL ORDER BY Clause is used to sort the records in ascending or descending order.

Syntax:
-----------
SELECT expressions  
FROM tables  
[WHERE conditions]  
ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ];  

Parameters:-
------------------
expressions: It specifies the columns that you want to retrieve.

tables: It specifies the tables, from where you want to retrieve records. There must be at least one table listed in the FROM clause.

WHERE conditions: It is optional. It specifies conditions that must be fulfilled for the records to be selected.

ASC: It is optional. It sorts the result set in ascending order by expression (default, if no modifier is provider).

DESC: It is also optional. It sorts the result set in descending order by expression.

MySQL ORDER BY: without using ASC/DESC attribute:-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use MySQL ORDER BY clause without specifying the ASC and DESC modifier then by default you will get the result in ascending order.

Execute the following query:

SELECT *  
FROM officers  
WHERE address = 'Lucknow'  
ORDER BY officer_name;  

MySQL ORDER BY: with ASC attribute:-
--------------------------------------------------------
Let's take an example to retrieve the data in ascending order.

Execute the following query:

SELECT *  
FROM officers  
WHERE address = 'Lucknow'  
ORDER BY officer_name ASC; 

MySQL ORDER BY: with DESC attribute:-
----------------------------------------------------------
SELECT *  
FROM officers  
WHERE address = 'Lucknow'  
ORDER BY officer_name DESC;
