MySQL LIKE condition:-
---------------------------------
In MySQL, LIKE condition is used to perform pattern matching to find the correct result. It is used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement with the combination of WHERE clause.

Syntax:
----------
expression LIKE pattern [ ESCAPE 'escape_character' ]  

Parameters
----------------
expression: It specifies a column or field.

pattern: It is a character expression that contains pattern matching.

escape_character: It is optional. It allows you to test for literal instances of a wildcard character such as % or _. If you do not provide the escape_character, MySQL assumes that "\" is the escape_character.

MySQL LIKE Examples:-
-----------------------------------
1) Using % (percent) Wildcard:
------------------------------------------
Consider a table "officers" having the following data.

SELECT officer_name  
FROM officers  
WHERE address LIKE 'Luck%';  

2) Using _ (Underscore) Wildcard:
-----------------------------------------------
We are using the same table "officers" in this example too.

Execute the following query:

     
SELECT officer_name  
FROM officers  
WHERE address LIKE 'Luc_now';  

3) Using NOT Operator:
---------------------------------
You can also use NOT operator with MySQL LIKE condition. This example shows the use of % wildcard with the NOT Operator.

Consider a table "officers" having the following data.

Execute the following query:

SELECT officer_name  
FROM officers  
WHERE address NOT LIKE 'Luck%';
