C++ Data Types:-
-------------------------
A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such as integer, floating, character etc.

There are 4 types of data types in C++ language.

Types 			Data Types
---------			-----------------
Basic Data Type 		int, char, float, double, etc

Derived Data Type 		array, pointer, etc

Enumeration Data Type 	enum

User Defined Data Type 	structure


Basic Data Types:-
--------------------------
The basic data types are integer-based and floating-point based. C++ language supports both signed and unsigned literals.

The memory size of basic data types may change according to 32 or 64 bit operating system.

Let's see the basic data types. It size is given according to 32 bit OS.

Data Types 		Memory Size 		Range
----------------		-----------------		-----------
char 			1 byte 			-128 to 127

signed char 		1 byte 			-128 to 127

unsigned char 		1 byte 			0 to 127

short 			2 byte 			-32,768 to 32,767

signed short 		2 byte 			-32,768 to 32,767

unsigned short 		2 byte 			 0 to 32,767

int 			2 byte 			-32,768 to 32,767

signed int 			2 byte 			-32,768 to 32,767

unsigned int 		2 byte 			0 to 32,767

short int 			2 byte 			-32,768 to 32,767

signed short int 		2 byte 			-32,768 to 32,767

unsigned short int 		2 byte 			0 to 32,767

long int 			4 byte

signed long int 		4 byte

unsigned long int 		4 byte

float 			4 byte

double 			8 byte

long double 		10 byte
