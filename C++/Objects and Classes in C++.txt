C++ Object and Class:-
----------------------------------
Since C++ is an object-oriented language, program is designed using objects and classes in C++.

C++ Object:
------------------
In C++, Object is a real world entity, for example, chair, car, pen, mobile, laptop etc.

In other words, object is an entity that has state and behavior. Here, state means data and behavior means functionality.

Object is a runtime entity, it is created at runtime.

Object is an instance of a class. All the members of the class can be accessed through object.

Let's see an example to create object of student class using s1 as the reference variable.

Student s1;  //creating an object of Student      

In this example, Student is the type and s1 is the reference variable that refers to the instance of Student class.

C++ Class:-
-----------------
In C++, object is a group of similar objects. It is a template from which objects are created. It can have fields, methods, constructors etc.

Let's see an example of C++ class that has three fields only.

class Student    
 {    
     public:  
     int id;  		//field or data member     
     float salary; 	//field or data member  
     String name;	//field or data member    
 }    

C++ Object and Class Example:-
---------------------------------------------
Let's see an example of class that has two fields: id and name. It creates instance of the class, initializes the object and prints the object value.

#include <iostream.h>
#include <conio.h>  
class Student 
{  
   public:  
      int id;		//data member (also instance variable)      
      string name;	//data member(also instance variable)      
};  
void main() 
{  
    Student s1; 	//creating an object of Student   
    s1.id = 201;    
    s1.name = "Sonoo Jaiswal";   
    cout<<s1.id;  
    cout<<s1.name;  
    getch();
}  

Output:
-----------
201
Sonoo Jaiswal

C++ Class Example: Initialize and Display data through method:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's see another example of C++ class where we are initializing and displaying object through method.

#include <iostream.h>
#include <conio.h>
class Student 
{  
   public:  
       int id;		//data member (also instance variable)      
       string name;	//data member(also instance variable)      
       void insert(int i, string n)    
        {    
            id = i;    
            name = n;    
        }    
       void display()    
        {    
            cout<<id<<"  "<<name;    
        }    
};  
int main(void) 
{  
    Student s1; //creating an object of Student   
    Student s2; //creating an object of Student  
    s1.insert(201, "Sonoo");    
    s2.insert(202, "Nakul");    
    s1.display();    
    s2.display();  
    return 0;  
}  

Output:
-----------
201  Sonoo
202  Nakul

C++ Class Example: Store and Display Employee Information:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's see another example of C++ class where we are storing and displaying employee information using method.

#include <iostream.h>
#include <conio.h> 
  
class Employee 
{  
   public:  
       int id;		//data member (also instance variable)      
       string name;	//data member(also instance variable)  
       float salary;  
       void insert(int i, string n, float s)    
        {    
            id = i;    
            name = n;    
            salary = s;  
        }    
       void display()    
        {    
            cout<<id<<"  "<<name<<"  "<<salary;    
        }    
};  
int main(void) 
{  
    Employee e1; 	//creating an object of Employee   
    Employee e2; 	//creating an object of Employee  
    e1.insert(201, "Sonoo",990000);    
    e2.insert(202, "Nakul", 29000);    
    e1.display();    
    e2.display();    
    return 0;  
}  

Output:
-----------
201  Sonoo  990000
202  Nakul  29000
