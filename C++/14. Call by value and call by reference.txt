Call by value and call by reference in C++
---------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to pass value or data to function in C language: call by value and call by reference. Original value is not modified in call by value but it is modified in call by reference.

Call by value in C++
----------------------------
In call by value, original value is not modified.

In call by value, value being passed to the function is locally stored by the function parameter in stack memory location. If you change the value of function parameter, it is changed for the current function only. It will not change the value of variable inside the caller method such as main().

Let's try to understand the concept of call by value in C++ language by the example given below:

#include<iostream.h>
#include<conio.h>
void change(int data);  
void main()  
{  
int data = 3;
clrscr();  
change(data);  
cout << "Value of the data is: " << data;
getch();
}  
void change(int data)  
{  
data = 5;  
}  

Output:
-----------
Value of the data is: 3

Call by reference in C++
----------------------------------
In call by reference, original value is modified because we pass reference (address).

Here, address of the value is passed in the function, so actual and formal arguments share the same address space. Hence, value changed inside the function, is reflected inside as well as outside the function.

Note: To understand the call by reference, you must have the basic knowledge of pointers.

#include<iostream.h>
#Include<conio.h>
void swap(int *x, int *y)  
{  
 int swap;  
 swap=*x;  
 *x=*y;  
 *y=swap;  
}  
void main()   
{    
 int x=500, y=100;    
 swap(&x, &y);  // passing value to function  
 cout<<"Value of x is: "<<x;  
 cout<<"Value of y is: "<<y;  
 getch();  
}    

Output:
-----------
Value of x is: 100
Value of y is: 500
