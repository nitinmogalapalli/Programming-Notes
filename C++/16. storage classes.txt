C++ Storage Classes
-----------------------------
Storage class is used to define the lifetime and visibility of a variable and/or function within a C++ program.

Lifetime refers to the period during which the variable remains active and visibility refers to the module of a program in which the variable is accessible.

There are five types of storage classes, which can be used in a C++ program

    Automatic
    Register
    Static
    External
    Mutable

Storage Class 	Keyword 		Lifetime 		Visibility 		Initial Value
--------------------	------------		-----------		-----------		----------------
Automatic 	auto 		Function Block 	Local 		Garbage

Register 		register 		Function Block 	Local 		Garbage

Mutable 		mutable 		Class 		Local 		Garbage

External 		extern 		Whole Program 	Global 		Zero

Static 		static 		Whole Program 	Local 		Zero

Automatic Storage Class
----------------------------------
It is the default storage class for all local variables. The auto keyword is applied to all local variables automatically.

    {   
    auto int y;  
    float y = 3.45;  
    }  

The above example defines two variables with a same storage class, auto can only be used within functions.

Register Storage Class
--------------------------------
The register variable allocates memory in register than RAM. Its size is same of register size. It has a faster access than other variables.

It is recommended to use register variable only for quick access such as in counter.

Note: We can't get the address of register variable.

    register int counter=0;    

Static Storage Class
----------------------------
The static variable is initialized only once and exists till the end of a program. It retains its value between multiple functions call.

The static variable has the default value 0 which is provided by compiler.

    #include <iostream.h>  
    
    void func() 
     {    
       static int i=0; //static variable    
       int j=0; //local variable    
       i++;    
       j++;    
       cout<<"i=" << i<<" and j=" <<j<<endl;    
    }    
    int main()  
    {  
     func();    
     func();    
     func();    
    }  

Output:
----------
i= 1 and j= 1
i= 2 and j= 1
i= 3 and j= 1

External Storage Class
--------------------------------
The extern variable is visible to all the programs. It is used if two or more files are sharing same variable or function.

    extern int counter=0;
