Why use CSS:-
----------------------
These are the three major benefits of CSS:

1) Solves a big problem:-
----------------------------------
Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.

2) Saves a lot of time:-
-------------------------------
CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.

3) Provide more attributes:-

CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.
