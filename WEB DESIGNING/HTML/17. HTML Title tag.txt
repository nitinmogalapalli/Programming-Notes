HTML Title:-
-----------------
HTML title tag is used to provide a title name for your webpage. It is necessary for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

The HTML title tag must be used inside the <head> tag.

The title of the page is displayed on the title bar of the browser.

Let's see the example of HTML title tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
    <title>First web page.</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <p>Welcome to my first web page.</p>  
</body>  
</html>  

Here you see that we are using two elements, the head tag and the title tag. The whole title element is within the head tag.

The head element which appears before body element just contains the information about the page but it doesn't display on the browser window. So, to display a title name on the web page, title element is used.

If you look at the above example, you will see that "First web page" will be displayed on the tab/ title bar of the browser. Content(text) between <title>.............</title> is shown on the title bar.
