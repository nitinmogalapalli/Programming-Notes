HTML NoScript Tag:-
-----------------------------
HTML <noscript> tag is used to define an alternate content for the users who have disabled scripting from the browser and want to access the web page.

The <noscript> element can be used within <head> and <body> tags.

While using noscript tag inside <head> element, <noscript> must contain <link>, <style>, and <meta> tags.

The text inside the <noscript> element will be displayed if the user's browser is not script supporting.

The example of noscript tag is given below:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script>  
document.write("Welcome to Javascript")  
</script>  
<noscript>Sorry! Your browser does not support JavaScript.!</noscript>  
</body>
</html>
