HTML Heading:-
-----------------------
A HTML heading or HTML h tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on the webpage. When you place the text within the heading tags <h1>.........</h1>, it is displayed on the browser in the bold format and size of the text depends on the number of heading.

There are six different HTML headings which are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

h1 is the largest heading tag and h6 is the smallest one. So h1 is used for most important heading and h6 is used for least important.

See this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Heading no. 1</h1>  
<h2>Heading no. 2</h2>  
<h3>Heading no. 3</h3>  
<h4>Heading no. 4</h4>  
<h5>Heading no. 5</h5>  
<h6>Heading no. 6</h6>  
</body>
</html>
