HTML Paragraph:-
--------------------------
HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage. Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point that a browser itself add an empty line before and after a paragraph.

See this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p>This is first paragraph.</p>  
<p>This is second paragraph.</p>  
<p>This is third paragraph.</p>  
</body>
</html>
