<blockquote> According to scientists, the bumblebee's body is too heavy and its wing span too   
small. Aerodynamically, the bumblebee cannot fly. But the bumblebee doesn't know that and it   
keeps flying. When you don't know your limitations, you go out and surprise yourself. In hindsight, you   
wonder if you had any limitations. The only limitations a person has are those that are self-  
imposed. Don't let education put limitations on you.</blockquote>
