Marquee HTML:-
------------------------
The Marquee HTML tag is a non-standard HTML element which is used to scroll a image or text horizontally or vertically.

In simple words, you can say that it scrolls the image or text up, down, left or right automatically.

Marquee tag was first introduced in early versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. It is compared with Netscape's blink element.

In slide marquee, all the contents to be scrolled will slide the entire length of marquee but stops at the end to display the content permanently.

</html>

Disadvantages HTML marquee:-
--------------------------------------------
1) Marquee may be distracting because human eyes are attracted towards movement and marquee text constantly.

2) Since Marquee text moves, so it is more difficult to click static text, depending on the scrolling speed.

3) It is a non-standard HTML element.

4) It draws user's attention needlessly and makes the text harder to read.
