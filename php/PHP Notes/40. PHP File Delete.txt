PHP Delete File:
-----------------------
In PHP, we can delete any file using unlink() function. The unlink() function accepts one argument only: file name. It is similar to UNIX C unlink() function.

PHP unlink() generates E_WARNING level error if file is not deleted. It returns TRUE if file is deleted successfully otherwise FALSE.

Syntax:
-----------
    bool unlink ( string $filename [, resource $context ] )  

$filename represents the name of the file to be deleted.

PHP Delete File Example:
-----------------------------------
    <?php      
    $status=unlink('data.txt');    
    if($status)
    {  
    echo "File deleted successfully";    
    }
    else
    {  
    echo "Sorry!";    
    }  
    ?>
