PHP Call By Reference :
----------------------------------
In case of PHP call by reference, actual value is modified if it is modified inside the function. In such case, you need to use & (ampersand) symbol with formal arguments. The & represents reference of the variable.

Let's understand the concept of call by reference by the help of examples.

Example 1 :
-----------------
In this example, variable $str is passed to the adder function where it is concatenated with 'Call By Reference' string. Here, printing $str variable results 'This is Call By Reference'. It is because changes are done in the actual variable $str.

    <?php  
    function adder(&$str2)  
    {  
        $str2 .= 'Call By Reference';  
    }  
    $str = 'This is ';  
    adder($str);  
    echo $str;  
    ?>

Example 2:
---------------
Let's understand PHP call by reference concept through another example.

    <?php  
    function increment(&$i)  
    {  
        $i++;  
    }  
    $i = 10;  
    increment($i);  
    echo $i;  
    ?>
