PHP String :-
-------------------
A PHP string is a sequence of characters i.e. used to store and manipulate text. There are 4 ways to specify string in PHP.

    single quoted
    double quoted
    heredoc syntax
    newdoc syntax (since PHP 5.3)

Single Quoted PHP String :
--------------------------------------
We can create a string in PHP by enclosing text in a single quote. It is the easiest way to specify string in PHP.

    <?php  
    $str='Hello text within single quote';  
    echo $str;  
    ?>  

We can store multiple line text, special characters and escape sequences in a single quoted PHP string.

    <?php  
    $str1='Hello text   
    multiple line  
    text within single quoted string';  
    $str2='Using double "quote" directly inside single quoted string';  
    $str3='Using escape sequences \n in single quoted string';  
    echo "$str1 <br/> $str2 <br/> $str3";  
    ?>  

Double Quoted PHP String :
----------------------------------------
In PHP, we can specify string through enclosing text within double quote also. But escape sequences and variables will be interpreted using double quote PHP strings.

    <?php  
    $str="Hello text within double quote";  
    echo $str;  
    ?>  

Now, you can't use double quote directly inside double quoted string.

    <?php  
    $str1="Using double "quote" directly inside double quoted string";  
    echo $str1;  
    ?>  

We can store multiple line text, special characters and escape sequences in a double quoted PHP string.

    <?php  
    $str1="Hello text   
    multiple line  
    text within double quoted string";  
    $str2="Using double \"quote\" with backslash inside double quoted string";  
    $str3="Using escape sequences \n in double quoted string";  
    echo "$str1 <br/> $str2 <br/> $str3";  
    ?>
