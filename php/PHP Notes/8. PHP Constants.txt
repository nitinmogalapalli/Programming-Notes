PHP Constants:
-----------------------
PHP constants are name or identifier that can't be changed during the execution of the script. PHP constants can be defined by 2 ways:

    Using define() function
    Using const keyword

PHP constants follow the same PHP variable rules. For example, it can be started with letter or underscore only.

Conventionally, PHP constants should be defined in uppercase letters.
PHP constant: define()

Let's see the syntax of define() function in PHP.

    define(name, value, case-insensitive)  

    name: specifies the constant name
    value: specifies the constant value
    case-insensitive: Default value is false. It means it is case sensitive by default.

Let's see the example to define PHP constant using define().

File: constant1.php

    <?php  
    define("MESSAGE","Hello Welcome to PHP");  
    echo MESSAGE;  
    ?>  

File: constant2.php

    <?php  
    define("MESSAGE","Hello Welcome to PHP",true);  //not case sensitive  
    echo MESSAGE;  
    echo message;  
    ?>  

File: constant3.php

    <?php  
    define("MESSAGE","Hello Welcome to PHP",false);//case sensitive  
    echo MESSAGE;  
    echo message;  
    ?>  

PHP constant: const keyword
-----------------------------------------
The const keyword defines constants at compile time. It is a language construct not a function.

It is bit faster than define().

It is always case sensitive.

File: constant4.php

    <?php  
    const MESSAGE="Hello const by Welcome to PHP";  
    echo MESSAGE;  
    ?>
