Python Object
--------------------
Python is an object oriented programming language. So its main focus is on objects unlike procedure oriented programming languages which mainly focuses on functions.

In object oriented programming language, object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.

Python Class

A class is a blueprint for the object. Let's understand it by an example:

Suppose a class is a prototype of a building. A building contains all the details about the floor, doors, windows, etc. we can make another buildings (as many as we want) based on these details. So building is a class and we can create many objects from a class.

An object is also called an instance of a class and the process of creating this object is known as instantiation.

Python classes contain all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming. A python class is a mixture of class mechanism of C++ and Modula-3.

Define a class in Python
---------------------------------
In Python, a class is defined by using a keyword class like a function definition begins with the keyword def.

Syntax of a class definition:
-------------------------------------
    class ClassName:  
        <statement-1>  
        .  
        .  
        .  
        <statement-N>  

Python Object Class Example
-----------------------------------------
    class Student:  
       def __init__(self, rollno, name):  
          self.rollno = rollno  
          self.name = name  
       def displayStudent(self):  
          print "rollno : ", self.rollno,  ", name: ", self.name  
    emp1 = Student(121, "Ajeet")  
    emp2 = Student(122, "Sonoo")  
    emp1.displayStudent()  
    emp2.displayStudent()  

Output:

    rollno :  121 , name:  Ajeet  
    rollno :  122 , name:  Sonoo
